# BankProjections

A comprehensive balance sheet projection tool for banks, designed for capital management, liquidity management, stress
testing, and planning.

## Overview

BankProjections enables financial institutions to:
- Project financials statements into the future
- Apply scenario-based projections with customizable time intervals
- Calculate amortization schedules for balance sheet items
- Compute regulatory metrics (capital ratios, ROC, LCR, NSFR)
- Output future balance sheet, regulatory metrics, income statement, and cashflow statement

## Features

- **Multi-scenario Support**: Run multiple projection scenarios
- **Flexible Input**: High-level or detailed balance sheet table and flexible scenario input templates.
- **Flexible Calculations**: Orchestrate calculation details using classification columns on the balance sheet and
  registries.
- **Runoff**: Calculate repayments, pre-payments, and coupon payements
- **Valuation**: Market value calculations based on scenario curves.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Calculate Basel III capital ratios and liquidity metrics
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Test and demonstrate capabilities without real bank data

Built on Polars, itâ€™s extremely fast and capable of handling portfolios with millions of loans. It is highly flexible to
adapt to any bank setup.

## Installation

### Development Setup

The code is developed in Python 3.13. See configuration in pyproject.toml for more details.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/woutersolutions/BankProjections.git
cd BankProjections

# Install in development mode with all dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

For an example, see the `src/examples/` directory. It contains a script `main.py` that demonstrates how to use the
library. It is based on synthetic data confidered in `example_bs.csv` and `example_params.yaml`, and uses an example
scenario input file `example_scenario.xlsx`. The script generate a synthethic balance sheet, perform the projections and
metric calculations, and output the results to Excel.
