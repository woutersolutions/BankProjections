# Code Quality Summary

This document summarizes the code quality improvements made to the BankProjections project.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Ruff Linting (✅ Completed)
- **Status**: All 12 linting issues resolved
- **Changes made**:
  - Removed duplicate function definitions
  - Updated imports to use `collections.abc` instead of `typing`
  - Added `strict=True` to all zip() calls
  - Renamed unused variables to underscore prefix
  - Used ternary operators instead of if-else blocks
  - Fixed line-too-long errors
- **Commit**: "Fix ruff linting issues and improve code style"

### 2. Mypy Type Checking (✅ Completed)
- **Status**: All 47 type errors resolved
- **Changes made**:
  - Added return type annotations to methods
  - Added proper type parameters to BaseRegistry generic class
  - Fixed None handling in strip_identifier functions
  - Added type ignore comments for pandas operations (necessary due to pandas type stubs)
  - Used walrus operator to avoid repeated calls
  - Fixed kwargs unpacking type issues
- **Commit**: "Fix all remaining mypy type errors"

### 3. Test Coverage (✅ Improved from 76% to 78%)
- **Status**: Coverage increased, target of 80% nearly achieved
- **New test files**:
  - `tests/test_audit_rule.py`: 7 tests for AuditRule
  - `tests/test_production_rule.py`: 13 tests for ProductionRule
  - Extended `tests/test_scenarios_templates.py`: Added tests for TaxTemplate, TaxRule, OneHeaderTemplate, KeyValueTemplate
- **Coverage by module**:
  - `scenarios/audit.py`: 98% (was 25%)
  - `scenarios/production.py`: 91% (was 18%)
  - `scenarios/tax.py`: 82% (was 0%)
  - `scenarios/template.py`: 56% (was 48%)
- **Commit**: "Add comprehensive tests for scenario rules and templates"

### 4. Runoff Logic Improvements (✅ Completed)
- **Status**: Improved NextCouponDate calculation logic
- **Changes made**:
  - Fixed NextCouponDate to be set to None only when items have actually matured
  - Added maturity date capping to ensure coupon dates don't exceed maturity
  - Reduced runoff test failures from 32 to 4
- **Commit**: "Improve runoff logic for NextCouponDate calculation"

## Remaining Issues

### Test Failures (33 failures, 260 passed)

#### 1. Runoff Tests (3 failures)
- **Files**: `tests/test_runoff.py`
- **Issue**: Validation failures for annuity redemption items
- **Root cause**: Unit tests don't call `initialize_new_date()` before applying runoff, but validation checks assume this has been called
- **Impact**: Medium - affects 3 tests
- **Recommended fix**: Either update tests to call `initialize_new_date()` or relax validation to handle unit test scenario

#### 2. Frequency Tests (10 failures)
- **Files**: `tests/test_frequency.py`
- **Issue**: AttributeError on frequency objects
- **Impact**: Medium - affects multiple frequency-related tests
- **Recommended fix**: Review Frequency class interface changes

#### 3. Metrics Tests (15 failures)
- **Files**: `tests/test_metrics.py`
- **Issue**: TypeError in DerivedAmount and DerivedWeight tests
- **Impact**: Medium - affects derived metrics testing
- **Recommended fix**: Review metrics initialization and expression handling

#### 4. Projection Tests (3 failures)
- **Files**: `tests/test_projection.py`
- **Issue**: ProjectionResult initialization and export tests
- **Impact**: Low - affects output functionality
- **Recommended fix**: Review ProjectionResult class changes

#### 5. Production Rule Tests (2 failures)
- **Files**: `tests/test_production_rule.py`
- **Issue**: Column not found errors when applying production rules
- **Impact**: Low - tests may need adjustment for balance sheet structure
- **Recommended fix**: Simplify test assertions or adjust balance sheet creation

### Coverage Gaps

#### Modules with <50% Coverage:
1. **metrics/metrics.py**: 0% - Not yet tested
2. **scenarios/curve.py**: 67% - Curve template loading logic
3. **scenarios/template_registry.py**: 56% - Template registry file loading
4. **utils/combine.py**: 56% - Combining balance sheets
5. **projections/time.py**: 33% - Time increment handling
6. **projections/market_data.py**: 45% - Market rate interpolation
7. **examples/efficiency_assessment.py**: 0% - Example script (OK to have low coverage)
8. **examples/main.py**: 0% - Example script (OK to have low coverage)

#### Recommended Next Steps for Coverage:
1. Add tests for market_data.py to cover rate interpolation
2. Add tests for time.py to cover increment creation and validation
3. Add tests for template_registry.py to cover Excel file loading
4. Add tests for curve.py template loading

## Code Quality Metrics

### Current Status:
- **Ruff**: ✅ 0 errors
- **Mypy**: ✅ 0 errors
- **Test Coverage**: 78% (target: 80%)
- **Test Success Rate**: 89% (260 passed, 33 failed)

### Trends:
- Coverage increased from 76% to 78% (+2%)
- Scenarios module coverage greatly improved (25% → 98% for audit.py)
- All linting and type checking issues resolved

## Recommendations

### High Priority:
1. Fix the 3 runoff test failures by adjusting validation or test setup
2. Fix frequency test failures (10 tests) - likely a simple interface issue

### Medium Priority:
3. Fix metrics test failures (15 tests) - may indicate actual bugs
4. Add tests to reach 80% coverage (focus on market_data.py and time.py)

### Low Priority:
5. Fix projection test failures (3 tests)
6. Fix production rule test failures (2 tests)
7. Increase coverage for template_registry.py and utils modules

## Summary

The project has made significant progress in code quality:
- ✅ All linting issues resolved
- ✅ All type checking errors resolved
- ✅ Test coverage improved from 76% to 78%
- ⚠️ 33 test failures remaining (mostly in frequency, metrics, and runoff)
- 📈 Next goal: Reach 80% test coverage and fix remaining test failures

The codebase is now significantly cleaner with proper type hints, no linting errors, and improved test coverage. The remaining work focuses on fixing existing test failures and adding a few more tests to reach the 80% coverage target.
